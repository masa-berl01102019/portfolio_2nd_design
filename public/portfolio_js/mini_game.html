            Each single character which user typed is taken from the event object of keydown and is validated every nth String object (the displayed word)
            in order from the top. when it's correct, it's replaced in '_' , and move to the next character.
            After the game, it shows the result that how much correctly user was able to type the words within the limited time by showing accuracy rate.</span></p>

            <span class="accordion_wrap_hide">The questions and choices of answer are stored in multidimensional arrays, and each of them are shuffled by using Fisher–Yates shuffle algorithm.
            Basically, objects is copied as a referance to the values, therefore I have assigned it to a variable in such a format:
            variable = [ ... array ] so that it's not rewritten original multidimensional arrays when the choices of answer is displayed in random order.
            The reason why I don't wanna rewrite it is because the location of the correct answer in multidimensional arrays is fixed
            so that it can be referenced to it when the choices is clicked, it's validated whether both textcontents are the same.</span></p>

            It's created dynamically elements except spin button by constructor method when its class instance is created.
            The url of image as a string is stored in an array.
            Then it's randomly assigned it to src attribute every 50 milliseconds by using setTimeout function when the spin button is clicked.
            The class instance which is designed a image panel with stop button, has been created three in an array.
            It's validated whether the value of src attribute of one class instance is different from the others when the all of them is stopped.
            Then if it's not same, the class instance is gatten dark by adding it to css class.
            Therefore it works like a slot machine.</span></p>

            <span class="accordion_wrap_hide">It's adopted object oriented design using two class objects.
            It's created dynamically elements by constructor function when its class instance which is controlling panels is created ( Board class ).
            Those elements creating panels has been stored in an array.
            It's randomly picked from the array which is stored the numbers from 1 to 16, then it's inserted into the panel's array by using splice function when start button is clicked.
            The other hand, the class instance which is controlling game ( Game class ) is managing start buttons function and timer function.
            The Board class instance has been called in Game class's constructor function so that the panels can be displayed when the Game class instance is created.
            "this" is passed as a argument when Board class instance is created, then it's received as a property in Board class's constructor function.
            Finally, it's been encapsulated by using method when each class object access properties of the other class.</span></p>
